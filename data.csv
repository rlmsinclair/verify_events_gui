cool_runnings_exe,26/02/2024 21:07,Hey all! On thursday we’ll be completing the Peep Lane fun run an Exeter tradition started by some locals 16 years ago that has continued ever since.   Every leap day a group of friends who lived near Peep lane (in between St Davids and Mill on the Exe) would race up it. They’re now in their 60s and can’t do it anymore but the tradition means a lot to them so they want someone to carry it on! And they’ve asked us!   We’ll meet at the bottom of forum hill (usual spot) and head down together. We’ll race up the lane and then head to impy where Dave one of the guys who started the tradition will join us. They’re entrusting Cool Runnings with carrying on a long standing tradition and we don’t want to let them down so it would be great to see as many of you guys there as possible :) It doesn’t matter if you don’t think you’ve got a chance of winning its genuinely just for fun!! 💚,https://www.instagram.com/p/C300Dy7rlv7,Gemini thinks: isEvent,GPT3.5 thinks: isNotEvent,GPT4 thinks: Unclassified
