Every leap day a group of friends who lived near Peep lane (in between St Davids and Mill on the Exe) would race up it. They’re now in their 60s and can’t do it anymore but the tradition means a lot to them so they want someone to carry it on! And they’ve asked us!   We’ll meet at the bottom of forum hill (usual spot) and head down together. We’ll race up the lane and then head to impy where Dave one of the guys who started the tradition will join us. They’re entrusting Cool Runnings with carrying on a long standing tradition and we don’t want to let them down so it would be great to see as many of you guys there as possible :) It doesn’t matter if you don’t think you’ve got a chance of winning its genuinely just for fun!! 💚,https://www.instagram.com/p/C300Dy7rlv7,isEvent

exeternasoc,2023-05-29 19:01:35,Hello! We are the North American Society at Exeter University!  Firstly we’d like to say a quick thank you to all of those who voted and made this society possible. We couldn’t have done it without you!  Our aims as a society is to provide a safe cultural and communal space for North American and non-North American students alike — all are welcome!  A large portion of our founders and committee members are international students (from North America) so we recognise that studying far from home and family can be difficult. We are hopeful that the events that we host this year provide a sense of community as well as to provide informative insights into North American culture and holidays for those who are not North American.   We would like to very briefly outline that we are NOT a politics-based society nor do we intend to be. We understand that politics within a cultural/continental society is inevitable but we discourage our members from using our society and events as places to debate and push political agendas. Of course we encourage healthy academic discourse surrounding world issues but this is not the priority of our society.  Our priority is to provide a sense of community which can sometimes become hostile with the inclusion of political discourse so we ask our members to refrain from debating during society events.   We are here to represent the continent of North America and look forward to meeting all of our future society members and form a close-knit group!   See you all next year! ❤️,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs1ooPYrhkx,isNotEvent

exetermotorsport,2023-05-06 18:39:41,EXETER ARE BUKC CHAMPIONS!!!  For the first-time in history and having come so close in previous years our A team have finally won the British Universities Karting Championship! We are beyond proud of the guys for their unbelievable efforts this year dominating the season with 4 round wins 8 round podiums and 9 race wins. A huge congrats to Jenson Sam Max and Ethan for some incredible driving throughout this year and we can’t wait to see the team back on track with the Number 1 kart as they attempt defend their crown next season!,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr6X1vsNo0X,isNotEvent
exetermotorsport,2024-02-28 18:44:16,BUKC Results - Buckmore Park  The A team headed to Buckmore Park with one aim to get their first silverware of the year after a rocky start to the season. The big news into the round was the addition of Nico into the A team starting our morning off with a strong drive from 31st to 19th in the wet conditions. Owen had a challenging race in his first full wet BUKC race maximising a lack of pace in the kart to a 17th place finish from 23rd. Jenson started from 13th quickly getting into 4th after the first 2 laps however would fall back to a finish of 7th after struggling to keep pace with the leaders. Sam would finish off our so far average morning with a clinical drive from 5th place picking up our first win of the season 🥇The team finished 10th in round 3 overall.  Jenson started off the afternoons races from 17th place putting together a solid drive to record 4th place. Owen started from pole in the next race trading fastest laps in the top 3 eventually finishing off in a strong 3rd place. Nico started from 36th in race 4  where inevitable incidents in the traffic would result in 26th place showing pace for much more. Sam finished off our afternoon with another 4th place for the team resulting in 3rd place in the round.  The B’s were met with a drier Buckmore Park the day after at the Inters championship being one driver short meant that all results would count. Aidan started off in race 1 from another strong qualifying of 8th. With great pace he picked the drivers infront off one by one ending in a would-be 2nd place if not for an unfortunate contact penalty on the last lap. Alex took over in his first inters race having qualified a great 18th place was fighting in 21st for the majority of the race until his race was undone by an incident then receiving a black flag while rejoining a busy track. Although the result wasn’t there it was a strong all round showing for Alex’s first inters race. Ollie finished off the B teams day putting together a stunning recovery drive from a disappointing P30 qualifying to record his best ever result of 13th place.,https://www.instagram.com/p/C35tQEKNC5s,isNotEvent

exetermotorsport,2024-02-12 13:25:35,BUKC Results - PFI  After three months off after qualifiers the A team returned back into action for the 1st and 2nd rounds of the mains championship at PFi. The day started off with Toby from P8 where mixed conditions would prove challenging resulting in a couple of mistakes despite good pace resulting in a 10th place finish. Sam took over in race 2 starting P15 however multiple incidents in the mid pack on the opening laps meant he had to settle for P16. The morning round started to take a turn when Owen charged into the lead from P21 on the grid however some questionable penalties turned a win on the road into P9 after penalties applied. Jenson had a solid race from the back start of 28th finishing P9 with the front pack too far ahead to make any further ground. A lacklustre morning resulted in 14th overall in the round.  Sam and Toby started off the afternoon endurance round from 10th on the grid. Despite a below average kart pits stops were maximised to get the best possible result of P8. From the back of the grid Jenson and Owen slowly worked their way up from 26th to a result of 6th place resulting in 8th place in the round.  A day later the B team arrived for the first round of the intermediate championship met by a cold and wet PFi. Sophie started off the race from P18 being in 16th before a spin would cap the result at 24th once again however showing good pace when all put together. Freddie had a solid race from P12 battling all race to finish a personal best 10th place. After qualifying blind due to a visor malfunction from P24 Nico made up 15 places on the first lap however he would manage technical issues through the race dropping to 16th by the end. Aidan would finish the team off with the best result of the day from his exceptional P4 in qualifying Aidan would quickly be in 2nd where he would pull away from the pack. Due to an ineligible driver in front this meant Aidan would pick up the win in his first ever intermediates event. The B team would end up in a solid 12th in the round as a result.,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3P8D5ht_Or,isNotEvent

freedomexeter,2024-02-27 11:07:26,The West some say is in decline. But what is ‘The West’? – and what is civilisation?   This week at Freedom the scholarly Rob Ivinson will be answering just this question with his robust and highly original conception of civilisation. According to Rob civilisations begin when humans throw off the shackles of communitarianism and harness their violence and strength towards a project of building higher culture rather than being content with mere survival and subsistence. This is he will contend the only definition of civilisation that can save us from the crisis of our time and liberate us from the waste and decay that is growing all around.   What is civilisation? How does it originate? And how can we right its course? Join us this Thursday to find out!,https://www.instagram.com/p/C32ULRLsm6q,isEvent
freedomexeter,2024-02-21 16:37:24,Huge thank you to everyone who came to our poker evening last night. Well done especially to those who made it to the final table and congratulations to Peter Freddie and Harrison for coming first second and third!,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3ndKseM0Yi,isNotEvent
freedomexeter,2024-02-19 11:46:12,Last week the press reported that the UK had slumped into a recession. But does it really matter? This week at Freedom our president emeritus will argue that after a decade and a half of stagnating living standards it’s time for a new way to assess our economy.   Reflecting on his experience working during his placement year James will investigate why our quality of life is not improving why most jobs are fake and why the economy isn’t actually real. We need a wholesale revaluation of our economic priorities to take on the rhetoric of the left without pining for an irrecoverable past or worshiping free markets. Join us on Thursday for a radical and revealing economic agenda necessary for finally improving the parts of life that matter!,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3hyQILsQav,isEvent
freedomexeter,2024-02-12 13:00:37,With a general election looming and a 20-point lead in the polls it seems that a Labour government led by Keir Starmer is all but a certainty. Sleepwalking as we are into this Labour super-majority our talk this week at Freedom will be on what Starmer’s regime will actually entail.   This Thursday one of our most loyal members Alfie will contend that a Starmer government will inflict irreversible damage on our nation reminiscent of prior Labour landslide victories - the creation of the NHS and the Town and Country Planning Act under Atlee; and the transformation of British Society under Blair cast dire warnings for what the next five years or more will look like.  A 'woke pay act' and Gordon Brown’s proposed destruction of our constitution are just two examples of what may be in store. On the right we look in vain for serious opposition to Starmer’s designs. What can we expect? What should we do? Find out this Thursday at the White Hart Inn!,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3P5NIeM5br,isEvent
freedomexeter,2024-02-11 15:15:41,Dear Freedom friends and followers  You are cordially invited to attend our second termly black-tie poker evening of the year in the snazzy Bootleggers cocktail bar. Like before the dress code will be strictly black tie and a £5 cash buy-in will be required IN ADDITION TO your purchasing of a ticket on FIXR. Additional buy-ins for those that squander all their chips early on will be allowed mid-way through play - and if you've never played poker before or you're a little rusty don't worry you can learn on the night.  After an evening of exhilarating gambling it's doubtless that a troop of our splendidly adorned members will make their way to some dimly-lit noisy hole resembling the Mos Eisley Cantina somewhere in town to either drown their sorrows or splash away their winnings. Last term the final pot amounted to a handsome £175 (35 buy-ins) the bulk of which was won by the victor but smaller prizes will be afforded to second and third place. We have no doubt that this term's poker evening will be even more successful than last term's.  You can purchase your tickets via the link in our bio and of course if you have any questions leave a comment below or drop us a DM. See you there!,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Nj3ePM69i,isEvent
freedomexeter,2024-02-05 12:36:21,In our current political climate some say it’s easy to lose hope – and indeed across the political spectrum there seems to exist a tendency to wallow in doom and despair. Pushing back against this inclination one of our most loyal freshers Jon will argue this week that all successful political movements share one thing in common: charismatic men and women fiercely principled and capable of inspiring hope in their followers. In the modern day however we find ourselves lacking these personified wellsprings of hope that we so sorely need.   Can we learn from the past drawing lessons from those who have come before us or should we look to the future and dare to imagine a brighter world? From the economy to education it seems as though despair surrounds us – so how do we rise up and strive forward?   For a message of hope and an answer to these questions we’ll see you at the White Hart this Thursday.,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2903STspfA,isEvent
freedomexeter,2024-01-28 18:09:58,Last year a government plan to process asylum seeker applications in Rwanda was declared ‘unlawful’ by the Supreme Court due to being in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) compliance with which is demanded by the Human Rights Act 1998. This week the Guardian reported that a broad coalition of innocuous-sounding charities ‘housing experts’ and anonymous officials were coming together to oppose government plans to prioritise social housing for British citizens.  From Brexit to small boats whenever something broadly ‘right-wing’ is attempted in government a phalanx of concerned civil society members and anonymous government officials seems to form to thwart it irrespective of democratic mandates. This Thursday one of our most loyal new members Peter will make the case that a ‘new McCarthyism’ is needed for positive change to occur in Britain. See you all at the White Hart!,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2p0rr8s8-G,isNotEvent
freedomexeter,2024-01-21 16:58:29,When it comes to foreign policy in Britain there are generally two schools of thought: the liberal interventionists and the isolationists. Broadly speaking liberal interventionists would position us in opposition to regimes around the world that don't hold liberal values while isolationists would decouple us from our traditional allies so as to warm relations with supposed competitors like China keeping Britain a friend to all but ally to none.   However this week’s speaker Andrew will argue that both of these are wrong - we don't have the resources to play world police but to eschew our traditional alliances in favour of friendship to all would assume we live in a world of rational actors which we do not. Andrew will argue that we are in the midst of a new Cold War with a Global South motivated in large part by a jealousy of Western prosperity and resentment over colonialism and that any domestic or foreign political strategy that fails to recognise this will ultimately fail.  How should Britain orient itself in the world in the 21st century? Who are our allies and who are our competitors?

therethinkingsoc,2024-02-10 12:01:18,Platonic love a form of love signifying the absence of romantic and sexual desire was named after Plato and is derived from his philosophical text ‘Symposium’. The text examines the subject of Eros analyzing the different ways humans can love each other and the overlapping and intersecting forms that love can take. Plato’s ‘Symposium’ argues that the divine Eros what we now refer to as ‘platonic love’ is the most supreme pure form of love. Was Plato right in this statement? What makes friendship so special to the human experience? Why do we pursue platonic relationships? How do platonic and queerplatonic relationships differ from each other? How do we maintain friendships in an increasingly lonely world?   We will be Rethinking Friendship on Thursday 15th February in the Forum seminar rooms 1 2 and 3 from 6 to 7pm. We hope to see you there and remember to bring a friend along! 🫂 • • #therethinkingsoc,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Ko09IoHjm,isEvent

cathsocexeter,2023-12-25 01:28:53,Today a saviour has been born to us: he is Christ the Lord!  Dear God As we celebrate Christ’s humble birth instil in us a spirit of humility. Teach us to surrender to Your will and trust in Your divine plan. Raise our thoughts to Jesus the Incarnate Word so that we may give up our worldly ambitions and put on the mind of Christ. May we remember that the greatest gift of today is the gift of Your Son who made salvation possible for the whole human race. Help us to share this news to those who have no hope and to carry Your love to all we meet. We ask this prayer with confidence in the intercession of Our Blessed Mother the Mediatrix of all graces.  Amen,https://www.instagram.com/p/C1QfFpjK9UE,isNotEvent

euowss,2024-02-21 11:08:42,INTRAMURAL RESULTS 💙  A big well done to our intramural team for their game results! 🏐  A message from our intramural sec Grace! :   After a successful first term finishing a respectable top-half of the table the EUOWSS netballers geared up for another season ready to fulfil our legacy as indestructible “human trees”. First game of the season was against powerlifting. Contrary to their title we knew we were the stronger team with a power lifter even admitting “we’ve already lost they do a cardio sport”… With some speedy center work some star shooting and some textbook human tree-like defence we locked in a 5-7 win.  Week 2 we took on the notorious Hispanic Soc. They employed some questions tactics from the get go but we stuck to our morals as wellbeing society of the year (vote for us for the Guild Awards ;) please). Sadly playing nice wasn’t enough and we ended the tough game with a 18-4 defeat.  Week 3 was against Law Society and with no subs EUOWSS geared up for an intense game. Despite giving it all we had we weren’t quite up to standard against the BUCS level netball Law Soc threw at us. “They must be professional or something” reported GD Danny… But with potentially our two toughest games of the term out of the way the team are ready to attack the rest of the season!  if you want to join our intramural team click the link in our bio to join the WhatsApp groupchat!💙,https://www.instagram.com/p/C3m3jTmIOD9,isNotEvent

You will attempt to talk about this topic for up to 2 minutes on the spot after this you will be given feedback if you would like some. If you are feeling a bit nervous just let me know and I will make adjustments depending on your preferences. If you are not currently feeling confident enough to commit to talking at the front then you are welcome to come and just watch and I will be open to ideas if there’s a variation you would feel comfortable doing. It doesn’t matter if you can’t talk for the chosen time or you go a bit off topic this is a casual environment and we want to support your development no matter how much experience you have at public speaking.  Do I need membership? – We are currently allowing people to show up for 2 sessions without membership but we ask that you get membership before turning up for a third session.

Those attending will be asked to provide a reserved ticket which can be found on FIXR via the link below and may be asked to provide proof of membership.  Climate Change is one of the biggest challenges facing our planet gradually degrading our ecosystem and standard of living across the world. But in at a time where most nations are widely rooted to capitalist incentives the drive for profit often motives far greater than the strive for change. Finding the litmus between truly eco-friendly products and rising profit remains a challenge for most brands advocating for climate welfare. With the consistent miss of global targets should governments be targeting businesses or seeking their help? Is buying into capitalist goals the solution to our problems?

Those attending will be asked to provide a reserved ticket which can be found on FIXR via the link below and may be asked to provide proof of membership.  The right to protest is a human right protected across the world by the Equality and Human Rights Commission giving people access to challenge the status quo. Disruptive protest serves as a powerful catalyst for social change however often at the expense of business as usual. From disrupting public and private transport to displays of vandalism and violence these polarising and confrontational tactics often generate as much backlash as they do publicity. Striking a balance between impactful disruptive protest and maintaining public support remains a challenge for activists advocating for change. With a history of success should disruptive protest be celebrated as a tool for social change or does its strain on individuals and authorities cause more harm than potential good in the long run?

Conscription is a centuries-old practice which has shaped military service across the globe. However while historically prevalent its relevance in the world of modern technology and nuclear warfare remains unsure. With recent news of reinstating standing armies in the UK this house debates whether conscription has a place in today’s society. Is conscription an outdated concept or do the strains of national defence outweigh individual freedoms?
