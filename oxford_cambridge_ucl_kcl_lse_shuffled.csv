We are so excited to finally announce our end of year show dancer auditions! We have such an incredible line up of talented choreographers creating the pieces for our show this year. 

The EOYS will be on March 20th, 21st and 22nd 2024, at Greenwood theatre. Dancer auditions begin on the 22nd of January and end on the 26th. Don’t be afraid to join and try something new! 

All in-person auditions will take place during the relevant piece/s rehearsal time slot which can be found in the post. The only audition that will be held at a different time slot is Mel and Lydia’s Lyrical, which will take place on Wednesday 24th from 21:00-22:00 in ARF (Strand). If you cannot make a rehearsal slot please contact the choreographer below to ask about a virtual audition. There is no need to sign up; just bring water and comfy clothes to dance in. The choreographer will teach you a section of choreography and then will contact you if you are successful. Do not worry about preparing anything in advance! Please come 5-10 minutes before the audition so a committee member can note down your contact information. 

We are really excited to see you all at auditions! Please reach out if you have any questions! Our choreographers are tagged below if you have any piece-specific questions. 

Our show name and colour will be released soon so stay tuned for this 😉👀

Responsibilities
Leading the 16-person committee and holding weekly committee meetings 
Oversee all Dance Soc activities from classes to shows to socials to comps
Ensuring that your committee are balancing their workload well with their uni work, and are prepared for their role - this includes the show production teams they’re in and also general and specific dance soc duties! 
Liaising with the Students Union and ArtsUCL on how to make Dance Soc even better, dealing with complaints, refunds and sometimes even filling out forms
Communicating with the society’s members regarding elections, special things going on in the society 
Producing ‘Triple Bill’, our annual charity show 

Gemma’s comments
I loved being President of Dance Society this year. I love my committee because everyone is giving their all to help Dance Society thrive and become even better! Being President isn’t for everyone. You need to have a love for Dance Soc and all that it brings. This role is chaotic, but so fulfilling and fun that you’ll grow to love it!!! 

Dance Society is one of the biggest societies at UCL, which means the workload is big, but I promise it is manageable!! It is by far one of the most rewarding things I’ve had the chance to be as you work closely with every single person on committee, feel proud of them and the activities, shows we are able to produce. 

On top of leading the society, you’ll also be the producer for our annual charity show Triple Bill. this year was a super success as we celebrated the 10th anniversary of TB!!! , this is one of the most enjoyable things I’ve done.

I believe the qualities you’d need are: problem solving, time management, multi-tasking, responsibility, being assertive, fair and passionate for Dance Soc. You will need to look at an event, and be able to foresee any possible problems and plan ahead of time to avoid issues, working with your team of 15 and getting things done. Most importantly, you should be dedicated to dance soc and genuinely care about the members and events - it makes the hours of unpaid work worth it <33

Responsibilities
Organise a wide range of inclusive socials for the society
Contact local bars and pubs for post show socials 
Plan the dance soc summer ball; you have a prod team to help!
Help to produce one of our many shows 

Tia’s comments:
Social secretary primarily involves the organisation of the events throughout the year - from movies, to quiz nights and the post show socials. Your biggest task is the planning of the summer ball at the end of the year!

This is a great role for somebody who is outgoing and friendly. The socials help to build a bigger sense of community, so make sure to offer a broad variety to include EVERYONE! Try and find things that fit in well with the rest of the dance soc calendar, it is a busy one! Beyond being a friendly face, you need some top notch organisation skills and a willingness to communicate on the phone with venue owners ;) 

The best part of this role for me has been connecting with a wide range of people in our dance community as well as the creative freedom that comes with it.

All in all, this role has been incredibly rewarding and I am so grateful for the wonderful peeps on my socials prod team and everybody who I have met along the way, new and old. There is also a huge amount of creative freedom that comes alongside being social sec so make the most of it!

@20:00 Saturday 21st October (Week 2)

PIRATES and MERMAIDS Theme 🏴‍☠️🧜🏼‍♀️

Mansfield and St Hildas combine once again to put on one of the best social events of the year. After the success of last year’s party, we made it even bigger and even better this year 👀

The rugby will be shown for those who are scared of missing it 👀🏉

We have dumped the paid bar from last year at the bottom of the river and created a proper house party feel with 3 massive bowls of punch (FREE) - drinks to be released soon. 

You can also bring your own drinks in a hipflask, bottle or however you choose!

Although there is drinking at the event, it is absolutely open to non-drinkers as well!

This event is open to EVERYONE IN MANSFIELD not just the rowers. So if you love an ERG more than your own parents or think every rower is annoying it does not matter at all. ALL ARE WELCOME :)

Some people might not know how to get down so will be having some people walk down from college at 7:45. More info to be released soon regarding that.

Purchase your tickets on FIXR using the link below! There are limited numbers of tickets so be quick!

Pls drop me a message if you have any questions.

Dr Clare Hickman is an environmental and medical historian focusing on post 1750 Britain, based at Newcastle University. Her recent Wellcome Fellowship, The Garden as a Laboratory, merged the history of medicine, health and science, with that of the landscape and environment. The research from this has just been published as a monograph, The Doctor’s Garden: Medicine, Science and Horticulture in Late Georgian Britain by Yale University Press. Other areas of expertise include the design and use of nineteenth and twentieth-century English hospital and asylum gardens, cold bathing as a healthy activity in the eighteenth-century landscape garden and the role of medical practitioners in the Victorian parks movement. Her research crosses the disciplinary boundaries of medical history, landscape history and history of science.

We invite the students from the Courtauld Institute of Art, King’s College, UCL, Goldsmiths and the Slade School of Fine Art to join us in the reflection on reconnect. A word that stands for another connection, coming back to something that was lost. We can think about it in many different aspects. As a reconnection with people (friends, family), lost habits, places or art (films, books, paintings). As students we can highlight the need of reconnection with our universities and the rest of the student body which was made unavailable to us in the current situation. We can wonder, why the initial contact has been lost or what is motivating the will for return. Why sometimes it is so important for us to reconnect? What feelings do we associate with the thing that we lost?
 
We invite everyone to submit their artworks on the theme of reconnect. They can have a form of visual art: painting, photography, drawing, sculpture, collage as well as literary texts. They will be showcased in an exhibition organized on the occasion of the 25th issue of the Courtauldian, a student-run arts and culture publication society at the Courtauld Institute of Art that focuses on support, treasure and embrace of artistic and literary talent. This event is a collaboration with the King’s College Art Society and students coming from Art History departments of UCL, Goldsmiths and the Slade School of Fine Arts.
 
The committee will select a number of participants who will receive a feature on the Courtauldian’s website as artist of the month, as well as a possibility to design a two-page spread in the next issue.
 
We hope this event will be a beginning of reconnection between the different artistic universities and schools all around London.
 
If you would like to contribute all you need is send your artwork to reconnect.submissions@gmail.com
By 27th of March.
The artworks will be showcased through an online exhibition. If the current restrictions in the UK change, they will also be presented at an in-person event.

This week we meet the big cheese 🧀 Chief Flying Instructor Neil.

🛫 What got you into gliding? ""I flew toy gliders in my youth (still do really), and had a few glider flights at Booker with my school friend's father, but even then it was obvious I couldn't afford that sort of expenditure. Then a week away a few years later flying Blaniks and T21's at a Sutton Bank holiday course. Then onto Oxford to learn on the K13's, Ka8 and a sweet club Ka6 CR.""

❤ Favourite gliding memory: ""Many spring to mind, like avoiding my first landout somewhere near Corby by blundering into a stubble fire which took me from 700' to 7000', luckily without setting the Ka6 on fire.
Also being on the team that replaced the failed diesel engine on the winch with a 'new' replacement overnight. Led by Andrew Butterfield, we started around 4pm on Saturday, and it was finished and ready for use on the Sunday morning. As is often the way, people on Sunday just carried on as normal with no idea of what had occurred.
The best thing in the past few years have the club trips away with a K21 to Aston down, Cambridge, Sutton Bank, and Long Mynd. We are hopefully doing Camphill next spring, if anyone wants to join us!""

⭐ Fun fact: Neil does indeed like cheese 🧀 ""my favourite is mascarpone"".

⬆ Next gliding goal? ""Ambitions, very few, but to continue enjoying gliding.""

📸: 1) Neil enjoying the sundeck of his DG (registration G-DEMU, apparently flies better than an actual emu), 2) part of Neil's CFI role is playing the role of ""worst student ever"" when training instructors, 3) Neil after taking Cotswold GC's K18 for a spin!",https://www.instagram.com/p/CzeY5ESh0lN/

I will write the full instructions here too:

1. Grind 38g of coffee beans into medium ground coffee, darker roasts might require a more course grind size to prevent over extraction. This is as less dense dark roasted beans are easier to extract than dense light roasted ones.

2. Insert a filter into the AeroPress as normal, then place your AeroPress over a carafe and pour in your ground coffee.

3. Place the puck puck water screen on the top of the ground coffee, making sure it’s as level as it can be - this helps to prevent channelling.

4. Attach PuckPuck and reservoir to the AeroPress.

5. Fill with water up to 500ml, then twist the collar until you achieve a steady drip rate of 50-60 drops per minute. (PuckPuck has a handy app to help with this.)

6. Wait, drink, enjoy. Your cold brew should be ready within a few hours. 

Hope everybody has a great week!",https://www.instagram.com/p/CjSQ8O7jyZ7/

The third day of trial flights had to be rescheduled because of bad weather. In total, we will be offering 87 trial flights. 

If you didn’t get one, there will still be many occasions to try gliding! Indeed, we will be offering more trial flights every Monday throughout Michaelmas and Lent Term.

🐉The London Crosstalk Club (伦敦相声大会), in collaboration with UCL CSSA @mist_dramastudio will be hosting a workshop titled 'Comedy on Campus' on the 20th of February, 10 days after the commencement of the Year of Loong.
@uclcssa_official

🙋Many people who have grown up in contemporary Chinese culture share a particular experience of watching traditional crosstalk during the Chinese New Year. Crosstalk, also known as Xiangsheng, has a special place in entertainment during the Spring Festival, it can be seen at the Chinese New Year Gala, presented to television audiences, or at the temple fairs, Miaohui, in front of live audiences. We are thrilled to organise this workshop in London, at UCL, with the hope of adding a little bit of laughter to the participants' experience of Chinese New Year.

👫We are delighted to announce that we will be inviting crosstalk actors and actresses with a wealth of experience in both China and overseas to perform, as well as discuss the interaction between a form of traditional comedy from the nineteenth century and the contemporary environment, especially in an overseas setting. Participants will also be invited to experience learning crosstalk and practicing Chinese calligraphy with the hosts.

Everyone is welcome! However, given that the main part of the workshop, the performance and discussion about crosstalk, will be in mandarin, and other parts of the event will include interactive experiences in Chinese language, fluency in Mandarin is desirable for non-native Chinese speakers to come along.

The talk will introduce attendees to the essentials of behavioral data science and its relevance to areas such as healthcare, public policy, education, and more. Through real-world case studies, the presentation will showcase how behavioral data science transforms traditional approaches, driving significant advancements in various sectors, particularly in fostering impactful behavioral change.

With a background in Transitional Justice and an MPhil in Education, Globalisation, and Development from the University of Cambridge, Abigail delved into the complex interplay of education and historical legacies, particularly regarding the understanding of the British Empire in secondary schools in England.

This exploration extended to examining educational institutions’ roles in shaping postcolonial knowledge. She also brings a wealth of experience from previous work on teaching apartheid histories in South Africa and the politics of academic publishing in West African universities. With a commitment to research and intervention against intimate partner violence, Abigail Branford continues to make valuable contributions to academia. Currently, Abigail Branford serves as a lecturer in African Studies at the University of Oxford, where she also completed her doctorate at the prestigious Department of Education.

lse,lsesubowling,2022-02-16T19:23:14.000Z,"Well, well, well….

First of all, let’s get off on the right foot. Yes, I am as surprised as you are to be reading this caption. But we actually ran a social. The annuls of LSE history will quake with what was a momentous occasion.

Let’s lay down some ground rules… 

1) DONT leave the meet with about 1 hour to go, especially without messaging us. We won’t bite. And we get it, we haven’t shown our faces since Freshers, but still, poor form. 

2) Lateness IS rudeness. Anakin Big Bowler learned that lesson. It starts at 4, not 4.17. In the future it will be punished 

Annnyway, what a day. They spoke of this social as a matter of fiction but boy, did we prove them wrong. Sec was on the beers since 9am to make sure he was on form for what was a momentous occasion.

Barman recognised me from last time and knew there were no straws required. Offered me a pint of their ‘house blend’. Interesting concoction. In hind sight it was probably fine-able but since they were offering free bowling I decided to allow it 

Bowling was underway, and there was no sign of the ‘Big Bowler’. After all that chat,aswell. You’ll learn for next time son. And there will be a next time, trust me on that. 

The old adage held true. Some things never change, as the sec pulled out yet another victory. He had to do it the hard way though, as Zaheen fought right till the end. But the sec, clutch as ever, turned up when it mattered most, and raised the victory in front of the people. Sal and Ben also performed well

What a day. One of those that people think would never live up to the hype. But it did. We will return. The train does not stop once it gets rolling. We are coming for the SU

Until next time",https://www.instagram.com/p/CaDL4KSg2Xe/
ucl,ucldodgeball,2023-11-27T16:20:15.000Z,"🎉WOMEN’S BUCS LEAGUE MEET 1🎉

With an amazing performance from last season, we headed into this season with high hopes. We may have lost some amazing players from last year, but this didn’t rattle our team. They took the challenge head on and hit a home run sky high!! ☄️

We started of against the formidable Winchester 1s, and what a game it was. It was a rollercoaster ride with both sides having a claw in the game. It was literally a tug of war but our MVP Yuna’s powerful shots gave us the final pull to help us gain a victory against them (11-9). 

One often meets their destiny, on the road they take to avoid it. Portsmouth 1s was our next challenge and we faced our destiny head on. It was a path we had to cross, but we marched through with no fears in our eyes. With a massive team performance, we succeeded a win (15-5) and our battle was legendary!!

Can’t wait for the next league meet. I hope this momentum will continue and for many more battles ahead!!!",https://www.instagram.com/p/C0J-12ktcQi/

Wazzaaaa , those of you accustomed to the club ,you may know me for my extremely witty nature , regular attendance to sports nights or from the world of upcoming professional gym via firnesswithvivek.  @fitnesswithvivek across all platforms . (I promise I’m really funny ) . I’ve been told by 2s legend Kettle that I’m ‘next up ‘ and ‘ soon to blow cuzzy’ whatever that means so it must be half decent . Now, I know you’re all wondering , Vivek what is your playing style like ? Well let me tell u, this team is nothing without me and my bulging biceps so let me tell u a bit about how I play. Imagine the physique of Peter crouch ( yes I’m tall get over it ) , intelligence of agbonlohor , bunds of Shaquiri and well that pretty much sums me up. 

After bottling running for treasurer, I decided to go for the highly contested ,prestigious 2s captain , don’t listen to what George says about it . As my first official act id like to apologise to the rest of commitee who now have to deal with chronically disease ridden breath from the new treasurer for the rest of the year . God bless you you poor bastards . 

Anyway, onto more pleasant smelling things , my plans for the year : 
-get everyone on the shankland tren training regime , 
-be very boring and not attend any sports nights , 
-convince Luski to join the 2s then proceed to bench him in place of the likes of Luke Harper

And well that’s about everything , look forward to leading the boys to another bottlejob this year.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CxgYXf8tveL/
oxford,ox.compsoc,2023-11-16T10:08:10.000Z,"The Unfairness of Fair Machine Learning: Levelling down and strict egalitarianism by default with Brent Mittelstadt

When: 5-6PM, Thursday 16th November

Where: Lecture Theatre B, Department of Computer Science 7 Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QG

Abstract: In recent years fairness in machine learning (ML) has emerged as a highly active area of research and development. Most define fairness in simple terms, where fairness means reducing gaps in performance or outcomes between demographic groups while preserving as much of the accuracy of the original system as possible. This oversimplification of equality through fairness measures is troubling. Many current fairness measures suffer from both fairness and performance degradation, or ""levelling down,"" where fairness is achieved by making every group worse off, or by bringing better performing groups down to the level of the worst off. When fairness can only be achieved by making everyone worse off in material or relational terms through injuries of stigma, loss of solidarity, unequal concern, and missed opportunities for substantive equality, something would appear to have gone wrong in translating the vague concept of 'fairness' into practice. In this talk I will examine the causes and prevalence of levelling down across fairML, and explore possible justifications and criticisms based on philosophical and legal theories of equality and distributive justice, as well as equality law jurisprudence. FairML does not currently engage in the type of measurement, reporting, or analysis necessary to justify levelling down in practice. I will propose a first step towards substantive equality in fairML: ""levelling up"" systems by design through enforcement of minimum acceptable harm thresholds, or ""minimum rate constraints,"" as fairness constraints. I will likewise propose an alternative harms-based framework to counter the oversimplified egalitarian framing currently dominant in the field and push future discussion more towards substantive equality opportunities and away from strict egalitarianism by default.",https://www.instagram.com/p/Czs_hFetxqR/

May God’s peace be unto you all.

We are devastated at the events that have unfolded over the past week. We recognise that many people within our community in Oxford have been personally affected as they have family and friends in Palestine and Israel, and we collectively mourn for all of the innocent lives that have been lost.

We also understand however that the events of this week have not taken place in a vacuum, but situated within the context of years of occupation and oppression. As such, we condemn the violence of the Israeli forces in Gaza and their decision to employ collective punishment, depriving civilians of food, water and electricity. 

We ask for all those in our community to come together in humanity, to contribute to the emergency appeal for Palestine and to remember to petition and protest against the siege in a lawful manner.

May God grant peace, justice, safety and security to all those affected in the region.

1 in ten people who menstruate that you know, among your friends, family, or colleagues, are/will suffer from endometriosis. That is as many people as those affected by diabetes in the UK. Help us make endometriosis patients considered! 

Please find linked in our bio an open letter to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, to advocate for the urgent need to fund research on endometriosis within the university.

Endometriosis is an often debilitating life-long condition currently estimated to affect at least 176 million people worldwide - yet we have no known cause nor definitive cure. We urgently need more research on it!

Share this video and sign the letter linked in bio to support endometriosis research. Together, we can make a difference! 🙌 💪🎗️

Queer Film Nights kicks off a season of globetrotting, genre-spanning, feel-good queer cinema with Gregg Araki's hangout classic 'Kaboom', described by one critic as 'Donnie Darko on viagra' and by our programmer as 'your new favourite film'.

Bisexual film student Smith (Thomas Dekker) spends his days hanging out with his partner-in-crime Stella (Haley Bennett), hooking up with fellow student London (Juno Temple), and lusting after his straight roommate Thor (Chris Zylka). Life is sweet. But he's been having strange dreams lately, some guys in animal masks keep showing up, and he's just been passed a note that says he's 'the chosen son'...

Underrated within Araki's filmography, Kaboom was the first recipient of the Cannes Film Festival's 'Queer Palm' award for groundbreaking LGBT cinema, and features music from Placebo, Ladytron, The xx, Interpol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and more!

Kaboom will be screened from Blu-ray and will be followed by an informal post-show group discussion.

Archbishops and bishops sit in the House of Lords, and the Monarch is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Is this right?

Abstract: A brief introduction to cybersecurity. Last year, the most common password, by one measure, was 123456. And the fourth-most common password was ... password. Suffice it to say we can do better, but there are trade-offs. Learn how you can keep your own computer and phone (more) secure. Just how private are your emails and texts?

Last Saturday, KCL and Sindhi Youth Club came together in cultural harmony to bring to King’s a slice of Sindh! We played games, ate incredible food, indulged in Sindhi art, watched film documentaries, and united everyone from all backgrounds to make this day an absolute success. 🧡

Amid the chilly weather, our shared pot-lunch saw contributors bring in soul-warming food of Sindh. For this, we had the pleasure of Sapna talking about the history and geography of Sindh, her debut cookbook, and the importance of comforting food from home! Give her a follow @sindhi.gusto and check out her website Sindhigusto.com to see more of the incredible things she does! 💚

We want to extend our gratitude to everyone who attended last weekend’s Sindhi Culture Ekta Day ‘23! Shoutout to @sindhigusto for her valuable contributions that brought quintessentially Sindhi food and all-important dialogue to this event! A very big thank you to @thesindhiyouthclub for making this event possible - we are so grateful!

The Womens Blues begin the week with a triumphant 6-1 victory over the Lions B as they begin to get cozy in second place in Division 1 South, securing Oxford’s position in the gold and silver spots for another week.

The Vikings A send UEA back to wherever it is they came here from, as despite a close first period they once again deliver another victory for the records.

The Vikings B narrowly avoid losing their chance at a 7 game win streak in their game against the Imperial Devils B on Monday, as one of the most intense games of the season for the Bikes led them to narrowly clinch a 3-2 victory, preserving their top spot in Division 2 South.

Hey everyone! I’m Sophie, a third year Biochemist at Trinity College and I’m honoured to be President of Oxford Women* in Business for Hilary Term 2024!

OxWIB was founded in 2008 with the mission of inspiring the next generation of leaders and breaking stereotypes in the world of business. Since then, OxWIB has grown immensely with a now 45-strong committee. We have been working hard over the winter break to plan our Hilary termcard and help develop resources to build commercial awareness!

This term I am particularly excited for our Inspirational Women’s Series and a new programme in close collaboration with the Saïd Business School, both of which will be launching soon. We’ll be exploring a broad spectrum of sectors including Entrepreneurship, Venture Capital, sustainability, social media and the civil service. We also have events designed to provide actionable advice and insights in the more traditional sectors like finance and consulting. We have our very first Poker Night, the publication of our next edition of the ‘Insight’ Magazine, continuation of our business news digest series and a fantastic President’s Drinks.

The people really do make this society what it is so I’d like to thank my committee for all the hard work that's gone into next term! I encourage you to stay up to date with our events and socials on our social media channels and to get an insight into the OxWIB committee.

How would you describe your role and your responsibility? “Collaborating closely with the President, we ensure the German Society operates effectively and seamlessly.

This talk will be held in the Pfizer Lecture Theatre, which is in the Department of Chemistry.
	
	Abstract by the speaker:
This lecture describes how I became fascinated in supercritical fluids (SCFs), which are gases such as CO2, compressed until they are nearly as dense as liquids. SCFs display an unusual combination of some of the properties of gases and liquids. I explain how SCFs led me to work in Green Chemistry, developing cleaner, more sustainable ways of making chemicals and materials. I also show how chance played a big role in determining how things developed for me and led me to the interface of chemistry and engineering. I thank all of my students, co-workers, collaborators, technicians and collaborators, particularly Professor Mike George, for all of their help and support. I also thank all of the organisations that have funded my research.",https://www.instagram.com/p/C3XPCJrMlFq/

*This is a taster event so no membership required💛

The Art Loss Register (ALR) holds the world’s largest private database of lost, stolen and looted art, antiques and collectibles, currently listing more than 700,000 items. Items are added to this database on behalf of the victims of looting or theft, insurers, police forces and others. Our database is then utilised to offer a due diligence service to clients in the art market who wish to ensure that they are working with items to which no claim will arise. This provides an invaluable risk management tool to our searching clients. Through searching it is also possible to identify stolen items and other claimed works as they move through the art market and to secure their recovery for the claimant.

*Edit: Our new speaker is Olivia Whitting, the Cultural Property Specialist and Client Manager UK and US Auction houses at the Art Loss Register. She is a graduate of the University of St Andrews and SOAS, and has been part of the Art Loss Register Team since 2019.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLvcDGoHPR/

The women's team started with a decent performance and although they had their ups and downs during the game, were able to not give away the lead and won with 22:32 (10:14). 
The men struggled to find their flow in the first half, making too many technical errors and missing goal opportunities. In the second half they gained more control and by keeping the energy up eventually won with a final score of 21:29 (11:12).

oxford,oxforduniathletics,2023-11-16T18:28:34.000Z,"At the weekend our freshers travelled to C*mbridge for their first taste of Varsity. Well done to all those who competed! The match report by Will Parry (Men’s Captain) is below:
On a crisp November morning at Iffley Road, the nervous but excited freshers made the journey to Cambridge to compete at the 2023 Fresher’s Varsity Match. Travelling with two trophies on board the coach, and the strong will to retain them, there was a big day ahead for the freshers. We made the journey to Wilberforce Road, took the traditional pre-varsity photos, and our freshers donned OUAC vests for the first time.
 
There was a strong start with success in many of the earlier events, with wins in both 400 hurdles and hammer, followed by a very strong performance from Sofia Stefani leading to an 800m victory on the women’s team. Laura Anene then started her very successful day with long jump, followed soon after by a triple jump win and personal best (in November!). Grace Cardwell heroicly decided to add the 100m hurdles to her already extensive list of events to gain some crucial points for the women’s team, with Quinn Pidgeon following in her footsteps. He volunteered to attempt the high hurdles with minimal practice, but still performed very impressively in the race. The sprinters were against very stiff competition, however helped display an excellent demonstration of composure, remaining relaxed, controlled, and fast in very cold conditions.

Throughout the day the throwers had been grouped at the far side of the track, churning out result after result with some exceptional throws mixed in there. Cayen Wang and Willem Jump were each asked to do a majority of the throws, with Wang winning both the javelin, hammer and shot put, whilst Jump managed a substantial win in the hammer. Perhaps the most notable feat of the day was a 52.45m javelin throw from Damon Zuber, who’d spent most of the day stuck on trains after delays on his travels to Wilberforce Road.

Despite their best efforts, the men didn’t quite manage to pip the tabs to the post, however, the women’s team retained the trophy after a draw, a very substantial feat for an away fixture, leaving lots to be excited for!",https://www.instagram.com/p/Czt4yIno2c1/

As many of you know, Syria has been under US and European sanctions for decades, making relief efforts even harder to reach the country's borders in a time of crisis like this. Even with the recently announced exemption, Syrians on the ground are continuing to suffer and endure the wait of receiving humanitarian assistance as the situation becomes progressively worse.    
   
Luckily, there are charity and aid initiatives that are working on the ground to do what they can, and so all proceedings will be split across a number of them.

As we don't like to repeat a distillery in a line up we thought the best way to fill out the tasting was to cross the border. There's a little room to explore in English with, in terms of number of distilleries, but again the selection showed a nice range and some interesting stories.

Inspiration for Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov’s symphonic suite Antar was derived from an Arabian legend in which Antar, a recluse living in the desert, kills a large bird to save a gazelle. Falling asleep, he dreams that the gazelle was the Queen of Palmyra, who, as a reward, grants him three joys: vengeance, power, and love. The first movement of Rimsky-Korsakov’s Suite depicts this narrative whilst the subsequent three explores each of the three joys respectively.

This event catered not only to students studying politics and policy, seeking context for their studies and firsthand insights into their subjects in real life, but also served as an eye-opener for those who might not have been familiar with the workings of Parliament.

The session began with an interactive lecture, followed by a lively Kahoot quiz that tested the participants' newfound knowledge and sparked healthy competition. This was followed by board games and group discussions, allowing attendees to network, exchange ideas, and explore parliamentary concepts in a more relaxed setting. The highlight was the presence of two representatives from the UK Parliament, whose firsthand accounts enriched the discussion, providing valuable insights and great advice for gaining a parliamentary career!

Our city, renowned for its intellectual prowess and cultural significance, has been a witness to the struggles and triumphs of the LGBTQIA+ community for centuries. From the shadows of secrecy to the forefront of advocacy, countless individuals have left an indelible mark on the city’s history. While some might be familiar with notable figures like Oscar Wilde at Magdalen College or Evelyn Waugh’s connection to Hertford College, the comprehensive range of queer experiences in Oxford has only recently been acknowledged and appreciated.
 
As we reflect on the past and celebrate the present, let us continue to stand together, united in the pursuit of a future where love, respect, and understanding prevail within the heart of our beloved city.

George received the award for his outstanding performance at this year’s Varsity match.

Clearly a hit with the ladies (Martha...), 'Daddy garg' Andrew returns this year to treat us once again to his plummy bass - the corridors are once again ringing with sonorous discussions of Oxford coffee houses or rare French wine vintages.

So Andrew, why did you join the gargs?
""As an enthusiastic young bass, the decision to dive into the intricate harmonies and improvisational spirit of jazz a cappella wasn't just a musical choice; it was a personal quest for self-expression, collaboration, and the sheer joy of..."" ect. ect. ect.

If you were a jazz musician, who would you be and why?
""Frank Sinatra - surely understandable"" [Steady on]

Favourite thing about Gargs?
""Ben Gilchrist""

Member of the gargs most likely to survive an apocalypse?
""Ben Gilchrist""

Tell me a joke!
""Wife asked if I'd seen the dog bowl, I said I didn't know he could!"" [this is deeply representative of Andrew's humour]

If you were a scat syllable, what would you be and why?
""Bah - you don't know when it will hit you"" 

Favourite Gaga song?
""Chromatica II""

Whoa!!! Thanks Andrew. Next stop, 73 questions for Vogue. Catch Andrew and his surprising Bahs on the 29TH OF NOVEMBER!!!

In an era of Social Media and fake news, many fear for the future of democracy. How fine is the line between regulation and censorship? Should platforms be held accountable for the content on their pages? Who is entitled to restrict false information? 

Join us to discuss these questions with Murtaza Husain, highly acclaimed journalist from The Intercept in New York City, at 6 PM GMT on Thursday the 18th of March.

Aimee: Captain of Coxes & Regatta Secretary 
“Apart from bumps racing which is just so unique there is no comparison, my favourite races are probably Milton Keynes regatta for the happy atmosphere and good weather, the novice regatta because it's a continual source of entertaining stories and fond memories to look back on, and shocking as it may seem Quintin head. Quintin was the first race I ever did and if you can survive being on the Tideway in January then you know you can do anything.”

Dominik: Webmaster & Regatta Secretary  “My favourite race so far was Day 2 of Torpids 2022 — we were chasing Balliol for the second day in a row, but they again managed to bump coming out of the gut.

We will meet outside The Mill Pub (near Scudamores), walk towards Grantchester- pausing to take inspiration- and finish at a cafe to reflect, write up our ideas, and share some readings from our own work or from 'Paterson'.

Social policy is all about the provision and distribution of welfare to the people. An often neglected group of citizens are children - without the right to vote and little capacity to express thought, children are especially vulnerable, particularly in times of global crisis such as now.

In 1988 he received the Wolf Prize in Physics, which he shared with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems.

In this talk, he will introduce his challenging views on the collapse of the wave function, linkage with consciousness, and offer his personal insights into the philosophy of quantum mechanics itself.

Xavier Brokmann, Quantitative Research Director will give the following talk: ‘Overfitting: perspectives from quantitative finance’

Abstract:
In-sample biases in systematic investing. Whether it's to discover new signals, build optimised portfolios or manage risk, systematic investing heavily relies on a familiar work horse: running back-tests on historical data.
In this talk, we will show that despite its many strengths, this approach also exposes systematic investing to various in-sample biases.
We will illustrate the magnitude of the challenge these biases represent in quantitative finance, and also discuss various approaches to mitigate them when designing systematic trading strategies.

There will be pizza and networking in the Central Core afterwards!",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy8lq3-opzc/

Karen Underwood – X-Press Legal Services
Karen Underwood currently owns and manages two businesses providing reports and data for conveyancers and property solicitors across the Thames Valley and Somerset. She started X-Press Legal Services as a franchise in 2007 and has constantly grown and expanded since then. 
However, this was not her planned career, and the journey has been an unusual one. Karen originally trained and worked as a professional dancer before giving that up to join her family firm of funeral directors. Here she qualified as the first female funeral director in Oxfordshire, gained business management qualifications and was the managing partner by the time the business was sold in 2000.
 
Rebecca Woolington – HR Central 
Rebecca Woolington is an accomplished qualified HR Professional with over 30 years of HR and Recruitment experience. Rebecca is the founder of HRCentral Limited, an independent, industry agnostic HR Consultancy offering HR support and talent acquisition on an hourly basis for SME across the UK.

Nicole Clewer – Clewer Communications 
Nicole Clewer is the founder of Clewer Communications and lover of all things social media. Nicole has worked in the social media industry for almost 5 years and is lucky enough to experience working on both sides of the grind, initially working as a social media ambassador for a renowned fitness brand, and working with brands such as Sure Deodorant and River Island. She now manages social media accounts for many successful businesses.

Diwali and Bandi Chor divas are celebrated on the same day every year. They are two different festivals where Diwali is celebrated by Hindus and Bandi Chhor Divas by Sikhs. 🪯🕉️

Bandi Chhor divas means “Prisoner Liberation Day ''. On this Day Sikhs celebrate the day the sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind ji was released from Gwalior Fort in 1619. Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji had been imprisoned by the Mughal emperor Jahangir for refusing to bow down to him . Once he had  returned to the holy city of Amritsar the whole city was lit up with diyas and lamps in their happiness of seeing him back. Some rituals Sikhs follow on this day are Visiting gurdwaras, listening to kirtan, lighting diyas and setting off fireworks. Sikhs also use Bandi Chhor Divas as an opportunity to reflect on the teachings of Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji taught Sikhs to stand up for what is right and to fight for justice. 

In Hinduism Diwali is celebrated usually during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kartika—between around mid-September and mid-November. Diwali  symbolises the spiritual ""victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. In southern India, Diwali celebrates the victory of Lord Krishna's destruction of the demon Naraka who is said to have imprisoned women and tormented his subjects. In northern India, Diwali honours the triumphant return of Lord Rama, his wife Sita, and brother Lakshmana, from a 14-year exile in the forest. Celebrations include :  Diya lighting, puja (worship and prayer), havan (fire offering), vrat (fasting), dāna (charity), melā (fairs/shows), home cleansing and decoration, fireworks, gifts, and partaking in a feast and sweets.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CzizaJlNqml/

ucl,sladesociety,2021-01-27T10:57:47.000Z,"TO ALL SLADE STUDENTS - NOTES FROM YESTERDAY'S UCL COMPENSATION MEETING!

Notes from the open meeting yesterday with Asserson Law Offices (who are the people putting together the case for student compensation due to strikes and the pandemic).
- Firstly, just to explain the basics of it, essentially they are aiming to refund between a third to a half of student fees. This is open to anyone who has studied at ucl between 2017 and 2021, as earlier years were still affected by strikes.
- Secondly, it’s really important that we get people to join the student group claim, which you can sign up for here: https://studentgroupclaim.co.uk/ The more students that join, the more money we can ask for. At the moment there are already over 2,000 students signed up, but Asserson is hoping and predicting between 5,000 – 10,000. There is no fee for joining, and there won’t be any financial cost to students throughout the case (all of it is covered by a litigation funder). 
- Thirdly, and really importantly, you cannot receive compensation unless you are signed up to the claim!!!! Please make sure you go through both stages of signing up, including putting in course info. 
- Fourthly, Asserson has said they will work directly with UCL to make sure students aren’t penalised for joining, which is very unlikely in the first place.
- Fifthly, out of any compensation given by UCL, we are guaranteed a 70% minimum (with 30% maximum going to Asserson and the litigation funder).
- Sixthly and lastly, the court process will be a long one (they estimate a year and a half) but after the initial sign up, there should be nothing more they need us to do on our end.
PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD AROUND, especially if you are part of other UCL societies – the more students join, the greater the compensation is likely to be

For Christian Louboutin, every woman is a work of art, a goddess meant to be celebrated, a life source of limitless power that ought to be unleashed. At the age of 16, he began an internship at the famed Folies Bergère, where the self-taught shoemaker began dressing the dancers’ feet with his designs.

Soon after, the world became his stage. Christian Louboutin’s sketches caught the eyes of various renowned designers to whom he lent his talents while learning the more technical aspects of his craft. In 1991, the designer embarked on a new adventure that would come to define his legacy: the inauguration of his first Parisian boutique.
And the rest, chéris, is red soled history.

Our next Women’s Vice-Captain is Jess, who is starting her second year in History and Politics.
Born to network, forced to row, Jess may have been groomed by her college parents into her rowing obsession (although she denies this), but her fierce stroking and fast splits are here to stay. Her proximity to the cox’s microphone provides the whole boat with constant comedic relief. Let’s hope it doesn’t always reach other boats on the river, or they might start questioning our sanity. 
Bring a coat when Jess is in the boat - beware of her splashing. She’s the reason that the club has Thames Water on speed dial to return the river level back to normal after she’s been rowing. Water belongs in the river, not the boat Jessica! 
As a horse girl, the river has been a new challenge that Jess has stepped up to, stroking the W2 crew to success in both the 2023 Torpids and Summer VIIIs campaigns. 
For Becks’ (her sculling partner) sake, and for anyone Jess might cox, let’s hope that Jess steers better on the river than on Mario Kart, or indeed than on the road. 
We can’t wait for the women’s side to benefit from Jess’ continual energy and vitality.",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx2qRoItThp/

Due to unforeseen circumstances Dr Lordan can no longer attend Sen Club this week. We will instead be joined at the same time and location by Eddy Zou, who will be giving a talk on the Econometrics Game.

Sign up with the link in our bio!

Eddy Zou is a research scholar at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and winner of the University of Chicago Oeconomica Econometrics Game 2021.

Here's an introduction for the talk:

The Econometrics Game, held annually, is a prestigious competition spearheaded by University of Chicago's Undergraduate Economics Research Society, Oeconomica, the Becker Friedman Institute, and the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics. It's a chance for undergraduates like you to dive deep into economic research and present your findings to an esteemed panel, including Nobel laureates like James Heckman and Lars Peter Hansen. Eddy was the winner of the The Econometrics Game and he will be sharing his award-winning paper on it.",https://www.instagram.com/p/C2qDF0ytmnx/

China is planning a 'Giant New Leap' - but who wins the semiconductor war?
(Article by Lucas Appleton)

Amidst a backdrop of a global microchip shortage, a new battleground is forming between East and West. Xi Jinping’s vision of a “Giant Leap” for China by 2035, amounting to the doubling of average GDP per capita, is ambitious. Access to high-quality semiconductors is key to achieving this. However, the imposition of ‘chip’ export regulations imposed by the USA to China over technology, manufacturing equipment as well as technical know-how and personnel will severely hinder this.
 
China already is a manufacturer of lower-quality chips. Building a new high-tech facility would cost an estimated $20 billion, with a risk that the technology would be obsolete upon construction. China’s interest in another producer of high-quality chip production is now clearer – Taiwan.

He’s done it!!!!! Finally, after 14 votes, it’s official. (This was written in September)

Hey guys, Mr RUMS FC here. As I’m sure you are aware, a certain (see slide 3) has introduced me to a world of fame within RUMS. This something I don’t take lightly, and therefore have developed 3 key principles in my life. LOYALTY, IDENTITY, RELIABILITY

Loyalty- pretty self explanatory really. I strive for loyalty in all walks of life. I’m hearing a few rumours about me joining UCL, but I’m here to put this bed once and for all. Cut me open and I bleed blue and yellow. (But please Ben Horsewell start me on Wednesday).

Identity- if you haven’t heard me mention it, I am a northerner. My whole personality is based on the fact I am from 2 hours north of London so expect steak bakes and sausage roll nights instead of horrifically awful curry nights this year! Also did you know I scored the winner at varsity last year? Oh sorry, forgot I already said it.

Reliability- Can always rely on me to make a bouncers night more difficult than it is to pronounce joes second name. Dunno what they’re complaining about all I did was call them a charva, must’ve been something to do w my accent. If u didn’t already know I scored in varsity wait no I mean I’m from up North, sorry about that . It’s not like me to mention varsity unnecessarily. Anyway ,another thing you can always rely on me is to always make it home on time. Even if It means sleeping in a church courtyard and turning up shoeless at 6 am.

To round it off here’s just a quick few of my likes and dislikes

Likes: calling simplicity 5 times during a sportsnight, Pete BOC, purple, head injuries, tuna 

Dislikes: MNF, returning home from a night out, Andras’ breath

Look forward to this year lads…and remember…. Keep it 🍋",https://www.instagram.com/p/C0cce5Jt_Sd/

⚡️Panel 1: “Beyond Earth: The Experience of an Italian Astronaut” with Paolo Nespoli at 16:30, LSE Lecture Theatre, Centre Building, LSE

Major Paolo Angelo Nespoli is an Italian astronaut and engineer of the European Space Agency (ESA). In 2007, he first traveled into space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery as a mission specialist of STS-120. In December 2010 he again traveled into space aboard the Soyuz TMA-20 spacecraft as an Expedition 26/27 flight engineer. Nespoli’s third spaceflight was on board Soyuz MS-05, which launched in July 2017 for Expedition 52/53.

Enrico Letta is an Italian politician who served as Prime Minister of Italy from April 2013 to February 2014, leading a grand coalition of centre-left and centre-right parties. He was the leader of the Democratic Party (PD) from March 2021 to March 2023. In 2023, the European Council appointed Enrico Letta as EU rapporteur on the future of the Single Market.

oxford,oxfordphilsoc,2024-02-06T17:15:15.000Z,"In this week's continental conversations, we will trace Edward Said's account of the development of the key features of Orientalism to better understand how Orientalism feeds into how we talk, view, and act towards the East.

Regarded as one of the leading public intellectuals of his time, literary and cultural critic Edward Said was steeped in the Western literary canon and was hailed as the father of postcolonial studies. Both an Arab Christian and an American citizen, Said's book Orientalism reflects upon how the Western-Eastern relationship is informed and upheld through purportedly objective academic discourse and skewed cultural representations, spanning the pre-colonial to post-colonial.

This cultural discourse, Orientalism, has mediated how the West views and interacts with the East, especially the Middle East, serving as an implicit justification for colonial ambitions; equally, this discourse has inserted itself onto how the East views itself. Furthermore, Said takes issue with the very ontological distinction made between ""the East"" and ""the West,"" arguing instead that this distinction is chiefly epistemological, artificially constituted through cultural discourse.

ucl,ucl_mma_club,2023-10-21T21:55:24.000Z,"What an incredible event between @uclbjj and @ucl_mma_club! 

I thoroughly enjoyed this meeting, under the relaxing social enjoyment of UFC 294 together, of two of the most demanding and rigorous clubs UCL offers.

Thank you to Max Lang for helping organize and  @amnnabhan for helping coordinate. 

I truly do appreciate the cross-networking of our two great organisations. 

When I first arrived to UCL and started reaching out as the MMA club president to clubs for cross promotion and activities, BJJ was one of the clubs who gave our fledgling MMA club a cold shoulder. This was many years ago when we were but 20 people in the club. 

Now, as two of the largest clubs (and arguable the most fun) we have the beginning of a great relationship sharing many of the same goals in fitness, discipline, and skillcraft and I know it's because greatness start with the tip of the spear and carries through all the way to the mighty shaft. So it's you @costello24 who has created an atmosphere within your club of openness and mutual respect and for that I thank you. 

It's my hope our two clubs will become even more closely aligned as we recognise the exceptional value that comes with camaraderie between fellow Scholar Warriors such as we are. 

United in the spirit of exceptional talent, rigorous training, and friendship and support of our fellow humans I look forward to our continued friendship and hope to do more joint events soon! 

Thank you all for coming!

And thank you to @uclsecurity for keeping us safe!",https://www.instagram.com/p/CyrTyRatAB3/

kcl,kclspace,2024-01-22T20:15:56.000Z,"In May 2027, NASA is launching its Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will look at the gaps between elongated groups of stars to help astronomers reveal dark matter! 

This will be done using globular clusters: sometimes stars can be stripped away from their globular clusters, causing ribbon-like streams of mostly gas and some stars. The gaps between these can possibly be caused by dark matter – there are a few streams in the Milky Way but astronomers want to look at globular cluster streams in other galaxies.

Roman will take a large snapshot of the Andromeda galaxy that isn't possible with any other telescope, and astronomers will be able to study globular cluster streams there. Dark matter is expected to interact with them, so the telescope team is developing a theoretical framework to determine where these streams originated and whether they'll be observable by the Roman. 

The second image is simulated, showing how much the Roman could capture in a single shot, and the image of the moon is provided for scale.
